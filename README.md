## We Were given a task by a AppleSeeds to build an app that uses a scraper with the theme of coexistence:

-  The app should scrape data from another page.

-  The app should be promoting or helping the idea of coexisting.

-  Bonus to upload the app the AWS.



## Prerequisites - Frontend local
* Clone the repo
* Install / make sure you have node v16+ ->  [Download from the official website](https://nodejs.org/en )
* Have all the package.json dependencies install by using this command in the root directory of the project
```bash
> npm install
```


* Make sure you have a `running and operational` backend!
* Small cup of coffee ðŸ˜‰â˜•

## How To Use The App

- Press the search bar up on the navbar and click on it
- Insert whatever it is you want to search posts about
- Wait for the backend to get all data you need filtered and ready to go.
- Pick a post from one of the posts cards and enjoy! ðŸ˜€

In order to run the app locally you will need to install all the dependencies from the package.json file.  
Run the command ``` npm install ``` to install all the dependencies, after it's done you can run ``` npm start``` to start the app locally in ```localhost:3000```

# Summary
By going through all the steps and making sure you have the prerequisites you:
- Deployed the app locally with all the dependencies needed.
- Can make calls to the backend and handle the responses from it.
- Should be able to view filtered posts.
